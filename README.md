# Adipocyte-Counter


With a microscope, it is not only possible to acquire several images that would be impossible to visualize with the naked eye, but also makes it possible to analyze various data that can be extracted from them. These data serve as a basis for scientific studies that allow the development of treatments, diagnoses of diseases and obtaining relevant information for future studies.
When it comes to images, computing has specific techniques, called Digital Image Processing, which allow, in an optimized and safe way, the extraction of data.
With that in mind, this work aims to develop software capable of counting a certain number of adipocytes given an image taken from a microscope, as this would help researchers from the Center for Biological and Health Sciences of the Cascavel Campus, providing a tool that, in addition to being fast and efficient, can save you time when performing the quantification of these cells and helps to parameterize the comparison between them.
This repository provides a software that was created as part of a final defense of the course conclusion work, to obtain a bachelor's degree in computer science, whereas this software not only can count adipocytes, but is free to use.
